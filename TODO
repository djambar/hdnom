# TODO

 * Direct prediction function
 * External validation / external calibration?
 * Kaplan-Meier curve for risk groups (use the calibration result?)
 * Record random seed used in web app report (need modify package functions?)

 * Allow users to download model from web app, to further play with in R package
 * Add above to vignette
 * Incorporate above into web app

# RESEARCH ON THIS

 * investigate calibration: glmnet.calibrate.internal.pred used x_te and y_te, but maybe should use x_tr and y_tr? Be consistent with predict.hdcox.

# DONE

 * Model comparison - validation/calibration
