# TODO

## PACKAGE

  * Kaplan-Meier curve for risk groups (use the [internal]/[external] calibration result)
  * log-rank test for risk groups (use the [internal]/[external] calibration result)
  * Add above to vignette

## WEB APP

  * Incorporate the above changes into web app
  * Allow users to download model from web app, to further play with in R package
  * Record the random seed used in web app report (need modify package functions?) - hdnom app used a single seed from the beginning through-out, 1. make sure it is fully used in server.R logic in every computation module, 2. record it and put it into the report.

# DONE

## PACKAGE

  * Model comparison - validation/calibration
  * Direct prediction function
  * FIX THIS: investigate calibration: glmnet.calibrate.internal.pred used x_te and y_te, but maybe should use x_tr and y_tr? Be consistent with predict.hdcox.model and hdnom.external.calibrate.
  * External validation / external calibration
