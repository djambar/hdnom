Nomogram for predicting the benefit of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy for patients with esophageal cancer: A SEER-Medicare analysis. [Cancer. 2014 Feb 15;120(4):492-8](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/cncr.28447/full) 

The [SEER-Medicare database](http://healthcaredelivery.cancer.gov/seermedicare/aboutdata/) is linked via a deidentified numeric system to include Medicare claims data on catalogued SEER patients, thereby allowing for the inclusion of clinical information not contained in [SEER](http://seer.cancer.gov/), such as receipt of chemotherapy. 

The [SEER Program](http://seer.cancer.gov/) is an epidemiologic surveillance system consisting of population-based tumor registries designed to track cancer incidence and survival in the United States. Collection of the SEER data began on January 1, 1973. The registries routinely collect information on newly diagnosed cancer patients residing in geographically defined areas. 
SEER 1973-2012 Research [Data File](http://seer.cancer.gov/data/) include SEER incidence and population data associated by age, sex, race, year of diagnosis, and geographic areas.
